# Java-socket-programming

This is a project developed for the ECCE Auth course - Computer Networks II

It is a simple progam demonstrating online communications using java and sockets. 
It is specifically designed to work with an in-campus server and to respond to the specific instructions designed for that partiqular server. Feel free to explore the code! :)
